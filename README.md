# NumPy Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the NumPy Tutorial Repository! This repository contains code and explanations for learning NumPy, starting from intermediate to advanced levels. Whether you are a beginner looking to advance your skills or an intermediate user aiming to master advanced concepts, this repository is for you.

## About NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two main Python files, each focusing on different levels of NumPy learning:

1. **Intermediate Level Tutorial** (`numpy_intermediate_tutorial.py`)
2. **Advanced Level Tutorial** (`numpy_advanced_tutorial.py`)

### Intermediate Level Tutorial

The `numpy_intermediate_tutorial.py` file covers the following intermediate-level NumPy concepts:

- **Array Manipulation**
  - Creating and reshaping arrays
  - Flattening and transposing arrays

- **Broadcasting**
  - Performing element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes

- **Basic Linear Algebra Operations**
  - Matrix multiplication
  - Element-wise multiplication
  - Determinant and inverse of a matrix
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors

### Advanced Level Tutorial

The `numpy_advanced_tutorial.py` file covers the following advanced-level NumPy concepts:

- **Advanced Indexing**
  - Boolean indexing
  - Fancy indexing

- **Broadcasting Tricks**
  - Advanced broadcasting for element-wise operations

- **Structured Arrays**
  - Creating and accessing structured arrays

- **More Complex Linear Algebra Operations**
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Solving systems of linear equations
  - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors using SVD
